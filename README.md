# Superstore-Dashboard-Analysis( Interactive Dashboard Creation using Tableau)

## Project Objective

The owner of the Superstore intends to create a comprehensive report to analyze the business performance. The report should include the following insights: 

 ### Overall Metrics:
   Total sales, total profit, and total orders, segmented by state, region, segment, category, and sub-category.  
 ### Top Performers:
   Identification of the top 10 customers based on sales, profit, and order volume.  
 ### Negative Profit Analysis:
   Highlight cities where the store is experiencing negative profits and identify the underlying reasons contributing to the loss.

The primary objective is to address the issue of negative profits in certain cities and take corrective measures to improve overall profitability.

## Questions

- How can sales, profit, and order trends be analyzed for each state?  
- What are the sales, profit, and order patterns across different regions?  
- How do sales, profit, and orders vary across customer segments?  
- What insights can be derived from sales, profit, and orders within each product category?  
- How can sales, profit, and orders be analyzed at the sub-category level?  
- Who are the top 10 customers of sales, profit, and order?
- How the trends of Sales and Profit varies over the years?
- What are key objectives for receiving negative projects in some cities?

## Superstore Analysis
  Based on these dashboards we understand that which states, cities, Categories, Sub Categories are  good at sales and bad at sales along with which are producing more 
  profits and  which are producing less profits. We also observe the top 10 Customers with high sales, top 10 who involved high profits and top 10 customers with more orders 
  in this analysis.
  
## Project Insights
   The analysis reveals that excessive discounts in certain cities are resulting in negative profits despite strong sales performance. Some products are being sold with 
   discounts as high as 50%, significantly impacting profitability. Additionally, every order includes a minimum discount of 20%, further reducing profit margins. It is 
   evident that optimizing the discount strategy can significantly enhance the Superstore's overall profitability.
