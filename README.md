1. ### Overall Metrics: Total sales, total profit, and total orders, segmented by state, region, segment, category, and sub-category.  
2. ### Top Performers: Identification of the top 10 customers based on sales, profit, and order volume.  
3. ### Negative Profit Analysis: Highlight cities where the store is experiencing negative profits and identify the underlying reasons contributing to the loss.

The primary objective is to address the issue of negative profits in certain cities and take corrective measures to improve overall profitability.
